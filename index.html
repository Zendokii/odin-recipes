    <ul>
        <li>2 cups Italian-style tipo 00 flour, plus additional for dusting</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Place flour on a marble or wooden work surface. Make a well in the center and crack in the eggs;
         add the salt. Gently beat eggs with a fork, 
         incorporating the surrounding flour, until batter is runny.
          Bring remaining flour into the batter using a bench scraper until dough forms a ball. 
          Mix in water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if dough feels too stiff.</p>
